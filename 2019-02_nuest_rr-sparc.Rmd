we made technical evaluations
we did surveys

most importantly: packaging systems of languages (R packages, PyPI packages, env.yml, Anaconda, pip freeze)

people always ask me: what makes this geo? why do you this at the institute for geoinformatics?

# What is spatial about reproducibility?

???

take a break, "interlude"

---
# GIS & GIScience specialities

poster "Executable research compendia in geoscience research infrastructures" > we have geoservices (for a long time, top down stuff)

large datasets (and just getting used to it)

big vendor for GIS

strong open source community

poster with Marius: Reproducible Earth observation analytics: challenges, ideas, and a study case on containerized land use change detection

yes, I do think that you cannot really do science with ArcGIS (there are MANY good applications for it of course)

not only about coding and git

using platforms
way how communicate and collaborate

# Open X

how open are GIScience journals? make a quick survey using Sherpa/RoMEO about giscience journals!

open review
open access

---
# Institutes, research groups, labs & conferences

final chapter of AGILE paper

one of our recommendations has a chance to become true!

# Openness + transparency + developer = ♥
